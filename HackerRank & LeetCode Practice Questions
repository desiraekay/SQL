#1 Report all customers who never order anything. Return the result table in any order. (LeetCode)

SELECT c.name AS 'customers' FROM customers c
WHERE c.id NOT IN
(
  SELECT customerid FROM orders
);


#2 Calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise. Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

SELECT employee_id,
IF(employee_id %2 != 0 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%', salary, 0)
  AS 'bonus'
  FROM employees
ORDER BY employee_id;


#3 Write an SQL query to report the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

SELECT name FROM customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL
GROUP BY name;


#4 Write an SQL query to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.

UPDATE salary 
SET sex = CASE 
            WHEN sex = 'm' THEN 'f'
            WHEN sex = 'f' THEN 'm'
            END
WHERE sex IN ('m', 'f');


#5 Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

DELETE p1 FROM person p1, person p2
WHERE p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id ;


#6 Write an SQL query to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

SELECT user_id, concat(UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)), LOWER(RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name)-1))) AS name FROM users
ORDER BY user_id;


#7 Write an SQL query to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.

SELECT sell_date, COUNT(distinct(product)) AS num_sold, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT(PRODUCT)ORDER BY PRODUCT ASC SEPARATOR ',') as products FROM activities
GROUP BY sell_date ORDER BY sell_date 


#8 Write an SQL query to report the patient_id, patient_name and conditions of the patients who have Type I Diabetes. Type I Diabetes always starts with DIAB1 prefix.

WHERE conditions LIKE '%DIAB1%'

ORDER BY patient_id;
