In this SQL, I'm using the SQLite RDBMS to query a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM JanSales;


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(product) FROM JanSales 
WHERE product = 'iPhone';


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT c.acctnum FROM customers c
INNER JOIN FebSales f
ON c.order_id = f.orderid;


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price) FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), price, SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(c.acctnum), AVG(f.quantity) * f.price AS ' average_order_total' FROM FebSales f 
    LEFT JOIN customers c
    ON f.orderid = c.order_id
WHERE f.quantity >= 2;


#8. List all of the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) FROM FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;


#9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT DISTINCT location, COUNT(orderID) FROM JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%New York%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >= 3;


#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT DISTINCT product, SUM(quantity) AS 'quantity' FROM FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product;


#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February? (average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account)
SELECT SUM(f.price*f.quantity)/COUNT(c.acctnum) AS 'Average Amount Spent' FROM FebSales 'f'
LEFT JOIN customers 'c'
ON c.order_id = f.orderID;


#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (overall average, not the average for each account individually)
SELECT SUM(f.quantity)/COUNT(c.acctnum) FROM FebSales 'f'
LEFT JOIN customers 'c'
ON c.order_id = f.orderID;


#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product, quantity, price, SUM(price*quantity) AS 'total revenue' FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY SUM(price*quantity) desc
LIMIT 1;
