In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(product) FROM JanSales 
WHERE product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT c.acctnum FROM customers c
INNER JOIN FebSales f
ON c.order_id = f.orderid;


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price) FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), price, SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(c.acctnum), AVG(f.quantity) * f.price AS ' average_order_total' FROM FebSales f 
    LEFT JOIN customers c
    ON f.orderid = c.order_id
WHERE f.quantity >= 2;
