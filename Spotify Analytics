# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 
# In the final question, I used SQLite Studio to write my own CTE with the Spotify data table.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL and coming up with my own questions. 


#What is the average danceability by artist and track? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability AS 'Track Danceability', AVG(danceability) AS 'Artist Danceability' FROM Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name ORDER BY AVG(danceability) desc;


#Who are the top 10 artists based on the average popularity of their songs? 
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;


#Who are the top 10 artists based on the popularity of each of their songs individually?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;


#Which artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

#Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity) AS 'average_popularity' FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)

SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE 
WHERE average_popularity >= 90;
